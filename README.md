The Tale of Three USB Chargers

Everyone seems to have a box full of USB chargers.   
Well, we do anyway and decided to pick two random "no name" 
chargers and pit them up against an official Apple USB charger.

The test setup was the same for each USB charger.   We swept a 
load that increases from 100mA until the USB charger went into 
protection (no voltage output).  We then check EMI/RF Noise 
and 'vampire drain'.
